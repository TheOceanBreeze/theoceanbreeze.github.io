<h4><strong>Free and Open Source Software</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Linux Distributions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a>: I run this on my primary gaming rig machine. It's an operating system that believes in the KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) ideology by letting you choose what to install on your machine. Installation is through a command line interface with no GUI. Not for the faint of heart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gentoo.org/">Gentoo Linux</a>: A source-based Linux Distrobution. I was originally going to use this to power my primary machine, but I don't wish to compile every package I need for my computer. I still consider it a good distro for those who want to experiment around and learn more about Linux and GNU.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu Linux</a>: For those just starting on their Linux journey, I encourage them to try this distro first. Owned by Canonical, Ubuntu strives in it's stable packaging of only 6 months per upgrade and providing graphical interfaces to make it accessible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Package Managers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman">Pacman</a>: The default package manager for Arch Linux. It is incredibly powerful and does its job very well. The recent addition to parellel downloading allows downloading multiple packatges at a time. It usually never breaks unless you do something unrecommended or dangerous, and even then it's easy to fix it with enough knoweledge and internet searching.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/morganamilo/paru">Paru</a>: Sadly, some packages are not hosted on Arch Linux's package page. This tool allows you to download pre-written instructions to compile programs that aren't available pre-compiled and updates them when necessary. It's also written in Rust, which is very cool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.flatpak.org/">Flatpak</a>: When you don't wish to compile a piece of software, Flatpak comes in handy. They have stable releases of your favorite software in containers so that you can enjoy a secure experience. I find it useful when I don't want to download a ton of pre-requisite junk on my computer for a program to run.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Desktop Environments</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gnome.org/">Gnome</a>: This is the main desktop environment I use. It's focus is to be user-friendly and minimal. I add extensions to it to add features I find useful and create a unique experience I like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/">KDE Plasma</a>: I used to use Plasma as my main desktop environment. After finding it unstable and crash-worthy, I switched to GNOME. Despite this, Plasma is very powerful in terms of customization and has come far from the past where only modern computers would be able to run it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Window Managers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://swaywm.org/">Sway</a>: I used to use this for months until I found it too complicated for my needs. It is very minimal, however. I recommend those with lower power computers to check it out.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Social Media Platforms</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>: After quitting Twitter, I find Mastodon to be a much better alternative. I feel I can really connect with people and I don't have to look at sad news stories nor advertisements. I use multiple accounts on different servers for different purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://pleroma.social/">Pleroma</a>: Pleroma is also Fediverse software, meaning people can connect with those on Mastodon and vice versa. If you're looking for a different interface/backend, you should try this.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Office</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a>: I use this to write stories before I publish them to DeviantArt. This way, I don't lose anything if a problem arrises. It is comparable to Microsoft Office.</li>
</ul>
