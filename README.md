Welcome to my website's repo. I use several technologies such as SASS[^1], Pug[^2], and 11ty[^3]. If you wish to use the code and/or use it as as template, feel free to follow the instructions below to get it setup properly. Otherwise, feel free to contact me for questions and enjoy! *The code is licensed under GPL v3, see [LICENSE](LICENSE) for more details.*


[^1]: It's like CSS on steroids, making websites look sharp.

[v2]: A HTML pre-compiler. It allows me to write less code.

[v3]: A static website generator. WYSIWYG!
