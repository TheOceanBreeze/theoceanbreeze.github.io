    <p>Hello everyone. I am making this post to anounce that I have stepped down as Owner from Aclevo. I have selected Smartninja365 to take over as my successor. He will now be in charge of handling all of the group and community matters hereforth.</p>
<p>Stepping down as an Owner will allow the community to move forward in a positive direction. Smart has already been producing miraculous changes behind the scenes, including adding Marcel as a Co-Owner. Marcel has been producing great content for his own YouTube Channel known as PenguinByte, and I trust that his contributions will make a lasting impact as seen by his previous works.</p>
<p>I will still be part of a community albeit taking on more minor roles to continue to support the new team in my own ways. Smart has given me my own &quot;Founder&quot; role to show that I am still the one who created Aclevo, and I thank him for voluntarily rewarding me with this role. Please remember, however, that this role does not impact this announcement.</p>
<p>I congratulate Smart for his recent promotion as Owner and I can't wait to see what the community has in store for the future.</p>
