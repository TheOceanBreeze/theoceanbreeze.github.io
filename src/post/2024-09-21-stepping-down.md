Hello everyone. I am making this post to anounce that I have stepped down as Owner from Aclevo. I have selected Smartninja365 to take over as my successor. He will now be in charge of handling all of the group and community matters hereforth.

Stepping down as an Owner will allow the community to move forward in a positive direction. Smart has already been producing miraculous changes behind the scenes, including adding Marcel as a Co-Owner. Marcel has been producing great content for his own YouTube Channel known as PenguinByte, and I trust that his contributions will make a lasting impact as seen by his previous works.

I will still be part of a community albeit taking on more minor roles to continue to support the new team in my own ways. Smart has given me my own "Founder" role to show that I am still the one who created Aclevo, and I thank him for voluntarily rewarding me with this role. Please remember, however, that this role does not impact this announcement.

I congratulate Smart for his recent promotion as Owner and I can't wait to see what the community has in store for the future.
