Hello! My name is Sean, also known as the nickname TheOceanBreeze. \
\
\
My hobbies are:
- chatting with friends online
- online roleplaying
- programming
- writing

I also like to play video games from time to time. My favorites are Civilization 6, SuperTux, and SuperTuxKart. Perhaps I will make a page dedicated to my favorite things soon. \

I use this website to write and post blog articles. You'll also find links to my other content below. If you like what you see, consider following me on my social media accounts.
