Hello! My name is TheOceanBreeze.


My hobbies are chatting with friends online, online roleplaying, programming, and writing. I also like to play video games from time to time. My favorites are Bejeweled, Stardew Valley, and Here Comes Niko.


I use this website to write and post articles. You'll also find links to my other content on this webpage. If you like what you see, consider following me on my social media accounts. If you're looking to contact me, feel free to visit the Contact page and I'll get back to you when I can. Thanks for visiting!



 My photography and my stories can be found on [DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/theoceanbreeze).
